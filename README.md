# Commerce Hub

A full-stack web application with authentication and CRUD operations, built as part of a Frontend Developer Intern assignment.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- React.js
- Framer Motion (animations)
- Axios (API calls)
- React Router (protected routes)

**Backend:**
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB (Database)
- JWT (Authentication)
- bcrypt (Password hashing)

## ✨ Features

### Authentication

### Product Management (CRUD Operations)
- **Create:** Add new products with details (name, price, quantity, category, company)
- **Read:** View all products in the system
- **Update:** Edit existing product information
- **Delete:** Remove products from the database with confirmation modal
- **Search:** Real-time search and filter products by name, category, or company

### User Profile
- View user profile information
- Update username
- Display account statistics:
  - Account creation date (extracted from MongoDB ObjectId)
  - Last login timestamp (managed via frontend state)
  - Total products added by the user
  - Recent 3 products added by the user

### UI/UX Features
- Smooth animations using Framer Motion
- Responsive design
- Loading states and error handling
- Delete confirmation modals
- Empty state illustrations
- Search with clear functionality
- Real-time form validation

## 📋 Database Schema

### Product Schema
```javascript
{
  name: String,
  price: String,
  quantity: Number,
  category: String,
  company: String,
  user_id: String  // Links product to the user who created it
}
```

### User Schema
```javascript
{
  name: String,
  email: String,
  password: String  // Hashed with bcrypt
}
```

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)
- npm or yarn

### Backend Setup
```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm install express cors mongoose jsonwebtoken bcrypt

# Create db/config.js with MongoDB connection
# Example:
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
mongoose.connect("mongodb://localhost:27017/ecommerce");

# Start the server
node index.js
```

### Frontend Setup
```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

The application will run on:
- Frontend: `http://localhost:5173`
- Backend: `http://localhost:9000`

## 🔐 Security Features

- **Password Hashing:** All passwords are hashed using bcrypt with 10 salt rounds before storage
- **JWT Authentication:** Secure token-based authentication system with 2-hour expiration
- **Protected Routes:** All product and profile endpoints require valid JWT token
- **Authorization Header:** Token sent via Bearer authentication
- **Password Exclusion:** Passwords never sent in API responses (`.select("-password")`)
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive try-catch blocks with appropriate status codes
- **Input Validation:** Server-side validation on all endpoints

## 📡 API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /signup` - User registration with hashed password
- `POST /login` - User login with password verification

### Products (All Protected)
- `GET /` - Get all products
- `POST /add-product` - Add new product (auto-assigns user_id)
- `GET /product/:_id` - Get single product by ID
- `PUT /product/:_id` - Update product
- `DELETE /product/:_id` - Delete product
- `GET /search/:key` - Search products by name, category, or company (case-insensitive regex)

### User Profile (All Protected)
- `GET /profile` - Get user profile with stats (name, email, account creation date, total products, recent 3 products)
- `PUT /profile/username` - Update username

### Protected Route Implementation
All protected endpoints use `verifyToken` middleware:
```javascript
Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>
```

- MongoDB database integration
- RESTful API design

✅ **Dashboard Features**

- Token expiration management

## 📈 Scalability Considerations

### Current Implementation
- Modular backend with middleware architecture
- JWT-based stateless authentication
- MongoDB for flexible schema management
- Component-based React architecture with reusable components
- Framer Motion for performant animations

### Production-Ready Improvements

**Backend Scaling:**
1. **Authentication Enhancement:**
   - Implement refresh token mechanism for better security
   - Move JWT secret to environment variables
   - Add token blacklisting for logout
   - Implement rate limiting (express-rate-limit)

2. **Database Optimization:**
   - Add indexes on frequently queried fields (email, user_id)
   - Implement database connection pooling
   - Add pagination for product listings
   - Consider MongoDB Atlas for cloud hosting

3. **API Improvements:**
   - Add API versioning (/api/v1/)
   - Implement request validation middleware (Joi/express-validator)
   - Add comprehensive logging (Winston/Morgan)
   - Implement proper error middleware

4. **Security Enhancements:**
   - Use environment variables (.env) for secrets
   - Implement helmet.js for security headers
   - Add input sanitization (express-mongo-sanitize)
   - Configure CORS properly for production domains
   - Move to httpOnly cookies instead of localStorage

**Frontend Scaling:**
1. **State Management:**
   - Implement Redux or Context API for global state
   - Use React Query for server state management
   - Add optimistic updates for better UX

2. **Performance:**
   - Implement code splitting and lazy loading
   - Add React.memo for expensive components
   - Optimize bundle size with tree shaking
   - Add service workers for offline functionality

3. **UI/UX:**
   - Add proper loading skeletons
   - Implement error boundaries
   - Add toast notifications (react-toastify)
   - Improve accessibility (ARIA labels)

**DevOps:**
1. Dockerize the application (separate containers for frontend, backend, MongoDB)
2. Set up CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
3. Implement automated testing (Jest, React Testing Library, Supertest)
4. Add monitoring and logging (PM2, Sentry)
5. Use reverse proxy (Nginx) for production

**Horizontal Scaling:**
- Load balancing across multiple backend instances
- Redis for session management and caching
- CDN for static assets
- Database sharding for large datasets

## 🤝 Contributing

- Full-stack integration capabilities
- Modern UI/UX with animations
- Scalability potential

## 📝 Development Notes

### Key Implementation Details:
- **Account Creation Date:** Extracted from MongoDB ObjectId timestamp (no separate field needed)
- **Last Login:** Managed via frontend localStorage/state
- **Token Storage:** JWT stored in localStorage (consider httpOnly cookies for production)
- **Password Security:** bcrypt with 10 salt rounds (industry standard)
- **Search:** Case-insensitive regex matching on name, category, and company fields

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Backend won't start:**
- Ensure MongoDB is running
- Check if port 9000 is available
- Verify all dependencies are installed (`npm install`)

**Frontend can't connect:**
- Ensure backend is running on port 9000
- Check CORS configuration
- Verify token is being sent in Authorization header

**Authentication errors:**
- Check if JWT secret matches between signup/login
- Verify token hasn't expired (2-hour limit)
- Ensure token is stored in localStorage
